3D Boids Version Information
============================

v0.91     Start Date: 26/12/2001   Finish Date: 27/12/2001
        - Removed the frame rate regulation/timing.  This allows the
          user to specify perfect frame synchronization or not by using
          their graphic card's advanced settings (OpenGL vertical sync).
          This solution provides the best performance across all the
          versions of the Windows platform.
        - Created and implemented a small black crosshair into the
          OpenGL view in the MFC Document/View Architecture.

v0.9      Start Date: 27/09/2001   Finish Date: 05/11/2001
        - Improved the about dialog so that the cursor and hyperlinks do
          not flicker unnecessarily.
        - Renamed the boid behaviours to cohesion, alignment and
          separation as now used by Craig Reynolds.
        - The V-Formation behaviour is now set to off as default.
        - Changed the colouring of the towers to a natural looking brown
          colour.
        - Changed the landscape collision avoidance representation from
          dots to lines.  This gives greater visibility at higher
          resolutions and also looks more appropriate.
        - Changed the maximum number of possible boids from 100 to 200.
        - Fixed a subtle bug where the flocking radius was wrongly used
          instead of the flock forming distance for the cohesion
          behaviour calculations.
        - Inverted the 'Camera Zoom' slider to become the 'Camera Distance'.
        - Added values to the control panel to display the current camera
          distance with also its elevation and rotation angles.
        - Corrected the 'Set Window Size' menu function to ONLY set the
          window size, instead of also repositioning it.
        - Added an new option of having a coastline as the landscape.
        - Added an new option of having a pier structure on the landscape.
        - Increased the gap of the landscape's wireframe overlay to prevent
          some minor stitching.
        - Added a fantastic speed optimization for when the user has the
          mouse over the OpenGL viewport to select a boid.  This almost
          doubles the frame rate =)
        - Added the flyer size to the control panel above the size slider.
        - Added an extra condition to prevent the camera from being
          incorrectly moved when the menu bar is activated and then the
          viewport is clicked.
        - Improved the menu bar so that each menu item is only represented
          by a single word.  This is the convention used by most GUI
          applications.
        - Created a colour selection dialog and added menu options for the
          user to change the colour of the boids or the background.
        - Added an option to animate the sea.
        - Made the sea slightly transparent.

v0.82     Start Date: 22/06/2001   Finish Date: 15/07/2001
        - Enhanced the simulation's timing by using a much better system,
          a high-resolution performance counter to be precise.  This
          produces very smooth timing in all versions of Windows, so
          all the previous jerkiness has at last been removed  :-)
        - Improved the frame rate regulation by using the above counter
          with an even more efficient and accurate algorithm.
        - Slightly reduced the size of the animated bird mesh to be more
          proportional to the other meshes.
        - Fixed a minor bug that prevented the wireframe landscape from
          being recalculated or flattened.
        - Improved the underlying object oriented design, making more use
          of inheritance and generic classes.
        - Improved the orientation calculations used for positioning the
          text to face the camera.  The generic classes were invaluable
          for this enhancement.
        - Reproduced all the flyer meshes so that their orientation points
          towards the positive z axis.  This enables all meshes to be
          oriented the same way, especially with the 3D text.  Doing this
          also optimized the mesh definitions, providing a more compact
          executable file for the final release.
        - Improved the timing of the wing flapping, so to prevent any
          jerkiness when the simulation is repeatedly stopped and
          restarted.
        - Changed internal colour representations to all use the same
          system, which is now floating point numbers.
        - Fixed a little juddering that occurred with the new V-formation
          behaviour.  Also removed the blue lines that showed the vector
          calculation offsets.
        - Added a bit more speed control to the boids, making them
          accelerate in certain circumstances, like when leading a
          V-formation.
        - Added an extra behaviour control option to fix the boids speed,
          this makes the boids behave purely by steering themselves, as
          in the original model defined by Craig Reynolds.  The fixed
          speed of the boids is set as the average of the maximum and
          minimum speed limits.
        - Improved the effectiveness of the random orientation for newly
          created boids.

v0.8      Start Date: 23/01/2001   Finish Date: 22/04/2001
        - Improved the flock forming algorithm.  So instead of moving to
          the nearest boid, the boid moves to the average position of the
          other boids in its visible range.
        - Added a new wing flapping offset variable for each boid, this
          allows the boids to have individual wing stroke phases.
        - Reduced the sizes of the tetra meshes to make them more
          proportional with the sizes of the other meshes.
        - Implemented behaviour weights so that no particular behaviour
          can override an other.  These weights are hard-coded into the
          source code.
        - Added a random behaviour option.  This allows the boids to
          behave in a chaotic fashion, in accordance with the current
          hard-coded weightings.
        - Added some very versatile camera control via dragging the mouse
          pointer over the OpenGL view-port.
        - Added an elevation slider to provide full 3D camera control.
        - Improved the landscape avoidance to prevent the boids clipping
          the tower as they fly past it.
        - Added the option of showing the boids landscape avoidance
          behaviour.
        - Added input validation to the flyer behaviour attributes dialog.
        - Added three new GUI buttons to Move camera to the next or
          previous boid and change the type of camera view.
        - Added the ability for the user to select a boid by using the
          mouse.  The camera moves to the selected boid when the left
          mouse button is single or double clicked.  Additionally the
          boid changes colour to orange when the mouse is over it, this
          assists the user in correctly selecting it.
        - Added smooth camera transitions when the position of the camera
          is changed by moving to another view type or boid.
        - Added three options for numbering the boids: full, mouse-over
          and no numbering.
        - Added four new main menu options for setting the number of
          towers in the landscape: 0, 1, 2, or 4.  The default number of
          towers has now been set to 2.
        - Added option to render the boids as sets of points.
        - Added option to render the landscape as a flat plane.  This
          facility makes the chequered colouring look quite good.
        - Added V-formation behaviour to the boids.  This can be activated
          or deactivated via the main menu and keyboard as with the
          other behaviours.
        - Added an extra menu item, to toggle the display of formation
          calculations as lines in OpenGL.
        - Improved the 'about' dialog box to be a proper dialog box
          complete with icon, coloured hyperlinks and mouse-over effects.
        - Added frame rate regulation, to limit demands on the hardware.
          The starting vertical refresh rate is used as the upper limit
          and the lower limit is set to 20 frames below this.  In
          Windows 9x, the upper frame rate limit is set to 85Hz as default.
        - Fixed a bug that caused the full screen mode not to be displayed
          properly, when the control panel was hidden on changing modes.

v0.7      Start Date: 18/04/2000   Finish Date: 16/07/2000
        - Converted the boids project to use the OpenGL graphics API.
          This sometimes produces just over 12x the performance as compared
          to D3DRM, using the same testing conditions.
        - Converted the internal class structure of the application to
          use the MFC Document View architecture.  This allows a splitter
          window to be used.  A splitter window is needed with OpenGL
          to prevent the MFC controls from flickering when double
          buffering is performed.
        - Added some nice colour interpolation to the tower.
        - Improved the camera view to the first boid.  Giving more
          independence of its orientation.  This makes the view seem
          more stable and also shows the boids turning motion quite well.

v0.54     Start Date: 04/03/2000   Finish Date: 18/04/2000
        - Simplified and optimized the code that generates the landscape,
          this produces a worthy performance increase of up to 33%.

v0.53     Start Date: 31/01/2000   Finish Date: 04/03/2000
        - Implemented a new Windows multitasking system that keeps
          consistent good performance and responsiveness in NT and 9x.
        - Reordered the sequence of the multitasking flags to a safer order.
        - Made the multitasking data members volatile to prevent any errors
          that could be caused by compiler optimizations.
        - Moved the window size member to the windows class from the
          application class.  To improve the object oriented design.
        - Fixed a slight bug which caused a crash in Win98 when sometimes
          resizing the main window.
        - Improved the responsiveness in Win2000 when the window is resized.
        - Improved the responsiveness of the control panel controls when
          redrawn in Windows 2000.
        - Improved the overall update frequency of the control panel's
          static controls.
        - Fixed a slight bug which caused a crash when full screen mode was
          repeatedly and rapidly activated in Win98.

v0.52     Start Date: 23/01/2000   Finish Date: 31/01/2000
        - Added extra functionality to enable the states of the boids to be
          saved or loaded to/from a configuration file (.ini).  The file is
          produced in a human readable form, so that settings can be manually
          adjusted.
        - Created an icon for the application.
        - Set the window's client area background brush to a hollow type.
          This helps to prevent overlapping windows erasing the graphics.
        - Added a new dialog box to allow some flyer attributes to be adjusted.

v0.51     Start Date: 24/12/1999   Finish Date: 23/01/2000
        - Re-designed and re-implemented the simulation's multitasking to become
          more responsive and optimized for Windows2000 and NT in general.
          This is considered to be the best approach to take, because of the
          long term shift towards NT based operating systems from Microsoft.
          Doing this helps to ensure the application's longevity.
        - Fixed a slight problem with Windows2000, added code to make the
          display dialog box always appear as the topmost window.
        - Implemented gradual change over of the boids meshes.  This prevents
          the simulation from locking up when changing to a large mesh.
        - Changed from using the MFC timer to using the system clock.  This
          increases accuracy, especially in Windows2000 which didn't work
          properly.
        - Added some code to stop the boids wings from flapping when they are
          prevented from moving by overloading.
        - Added options for the colouring of the solid landscape.  Included an
          option to set the land to a chequered black and white style.
        - Added options for setting the colours of the flyers.  This is needed
          for contrasting the colours to the chequered landscape colours.

v0.5      Start Date: 02/12/1999   Finish Date: 24/12/1999
        - Added a simple pointed brown tower to the landscape, for testing the
          boids new collision avoidance AI to be implemented.
        - Enhanced the accuracy of the landscape collision detection by using
          the correct mathematical 3D plane equations.
        - Added some preliminary landscape tower avoidance AI.
        - Added a proper rectangular tower to the landscape.
        - Tested in Windows 2000 RC2 and found that the thread priorities are
          very different.  But there is no problem in 98 and NT4, therefore
          I have decided to wait for a newer version of Win2000 for testing.
        - Fixed a minor bug with adding too many extra boids via the keyboard.
        - Added a new constant UPWARD_ANGLE_FROM_COLLISION for last resort
          collision avoidance behaviour.
        - Added a new constant SIDE_CLEARANCE_ANGLE for giving the boids some
          very basic side clearance around the towers.

v0.498    Start Date: 11/11/1999   Finish Date: 02/12/1999
        - Added code to prevent the simulation changing the mesh to a type that
          is already in use.
        - Added code to allow the landscape to have a wireframe overlay.
        - Changed the camera menu item from 'From Boid' to 'To Boid'.
        - Added a new constant called MAXIMUM_TIMESPAN to prevent the boids from
          jumping when then next update is delayed.  This improvement also stops
          the boids from being interfered with when their meshes are changed.
        - Set the optimum priority for the rendering thread in NT4 to be
          THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL, found that one this works the best.
        - Changed the select full screen mode dialog to have the default button
          as Activate mode.  Seems more appropriate and intuitive.
        - Added code to prevent the 'To Boid' camera view from going inside
          the boid.

v0.497    Start Date: 26/10/1999   Finish Date: 11/11/1999
        - Experimented and investigated ways of increasing the responsiveness of
          the user interface sliders.  Decided to place a limit on the minimum
          frame rate to prevent any slow down and crashing.  When the limit is
          exceeded the number of boids will become restricted.
        - Implemented some features to prevent user overloading the simulation.
        - Fixed a bug when adding boids to the scene, have to stop the rendering
          thread while doing this.
        - Added code to destroy the menu when in full screen mode.
        - Added code to re-style the window as a POPUP when in full screen mode.

v0.496    Start Date: 23/10/1999   Finish Date: 26/10/1999
        - Fixed a bug with the update of the static control showing the number
          of flyers active.
        - Added a dialog box that allows the user to select and activate
          available display modes.
        - Tested the display modes in NT4.  Found that low resolution modes were
          a little unstable concerning the restoration of the windowed mode.
        - Tested the display modes dialog in Windows 2000 beta3.  Found that
          the dialog was not properly presented when first created.  It remained
          hidden under the main window.
        - Added menu options and accelerator keys to set the size of the window.

v0.4952   Start Date: 03/10/1999   Finish Date: 23/10/1999
        - Added a Boolean data member to the window class for full screen mode.
        - Added a flag to determine whether the simulation starts up in a window
          or full screen mode.
        - Changed the name of the function OnStop to OnStartStop.
        - Added a menu item to start or stop the simulation.
        - Tested full screen mode in NT5 beta3 and found that if the mouse is
          displayed it interferes with the smoothness of the rendering.  NT4 was
          fine with the mouse present.
        - Added a flag to the main window to state whether to shutdown or not.
        - Added menu items to allow the user to change the display mode.
        - Added code to return the focus back to the main window when one of the
          control panel controls has been used.  This allows the user to press
          the ESC key, especially when in full screen mode.
        - Added code to allow the user to change to full screen mode via the
          menu.
        - Added code to allow the user to change back to windowed mode from full
          screen mode, by pressing the ESC key.
        - Added a colour data member to the flyer boid.
        - Changed the background colour from light grey to a sky light blue.
        - Added a little ambient light to the scene.
        - Fixed a bug when starting up in full screen mode and later changing
          back to windowed mode via the menu.  The restore size of the window
          was invalid.
        - Added the option of making the control panel hide / show via the
          menu bar.
        - Also added the option of showing the control panel on startup via the
          default constants.
        - Improved and experimented with the boid camera views code.
        - Added a new size data member to the flyer class.
        - Added a new getSize member function to the flyer class and updated
          other parts of program code to use it.
        - Fixed the bug when the window is maximised and full screen is set, and
          then windowed is restored to fill the whole screen.
        - Tried to implement ALT + ENTER keyboard command via the GetKeyState
          function but it failed to work properly.
        - Added Accelerator keys and also replaced the previous keyboard event
          handler.
        - Added keyboard control for the slider controls.
        - Changed the parameter on the add & remove flyers methods to the amount
          to add or remove.
        - Added code to stop the simulation while changing the boid's meshes.
        - Fixed a bug with the camera position slider in the NSEW views (a zero
          value).
        - Added code to make the camera rotation slider wrap around smoothly.
        - Added a menu item and keyboard command to centre the camera rotation.
        - Added code to refresh the whole viewport every second, to
          clear up junk.
        - Added code to repaint all the control panel controls every second, to
          clear up junk.

v0.4951   Start Date: 29/09/1999   Finish Date: 03/10/1999
        - Changed the mode of operation to a full screen mode application.
        - Added keyboard functionality to allow the user to press the escape key
          to exit the application.

v0.495    Start Date: 25/09/1999   Finish Date: 29/09/1999
        - Added extra boid mesh shape options that can be activated by the menu.
        - Added animated flapping wings to a selectable boid mesh.
        - Experimented with increasing the precision of the maths to prevent any
          juddering when viewed from a boid camera position.  But found that the
          best improvement was to run the simulation in Windows NT for great
          smoothness.  Therefore I left the maths precision as it was
          previously.
        - Changed name from BoidsObj to BoidsFlyer.
        - Improved land collision detection, by performing a coordinate check on
          the selected patch.
        - Improved collision avoidance with the landscape by increasing the rate
          of change of velocity of the boids.  This allows them to turn faster.
        - Added a new constant to the flyer boid for the acceleration rate.
        - Added another new constant for the flying boids clearance distance
          from the landscape.

v0.4944   Start Date: 14/09/1999   Finish Date: 25/09/1999
        - Implemented a second thread for the D3D rendering and GUI update.
          This solves the problem of the about box erasing the rendered image,
          also the disruption and timing interference when manipulating the
          window.  This addition works very well in Windows 2000 which is good
          for future usage.
        - Found that also using the onIdle function to render in addition to the
          rendering thread, can increase the frame rates in Windows 98.
          No problems encountered with this in all the other versions of
          Windows.
        - Fixed the problems of using the camera on a boid with zero
          boids in use.
        - Fixed the problem of using the GUID, by including the proper library.
        - Cleaned up and sorted the header files and libraries used.
        - Fixed a shutdown bug in Windows 98, concerning waiting for the
          rendering thread to finish properly.
        - Changed the menu item called Render to Objects.
        - Changed the static label from number of objects to number of flyers.
        - Added an extra slider that controls the rotation of the camera views.
        - Added a button to quickly centre the camera rotation slider.
        - Added a stop/restart button.

v0.4943   Start Date: 14/09/1999   Finish Date: 14/09/1999
        - Added extra CStatic controls for proper spacing in the control panel.

v0.4942   Start Date: 02/09/1999   Finish Date: 14/09/1999
        - Added Gouraud shading to the landscape.
        - Fixed the boid wrap around function, to keep the boids in their space
          properly.
        - Added menu items to change the landscape rendering style dynamically.
        - Added code to make an X file an application resource in an exe file.
        - Found that NT4 version crashes with a change of landscape rendering
          style.
        - Fixed the landscape rendering style change to work in NT4.
        - Added a menu option to remove the landscape from the simulation.
        - Added a menu option to recalculate the heights of the landscape.
        - Fixed a problem when switching between flat and gouraud shading.
        - Moved all constants to their respective header files in the
          source code.
        - Added menu items to toggle the activation of the boids A.I.
        - Added code to only allow the correct scroll bar to be updated at a
          time.
        - Added six camera views activated by the menu bar.
        - Added a function to the boid, to get its required velocity components.
        - Added a function to the boid, to get its velocity components.
        - Added A.I. to the boids to make them smoothly avoid the landscape,
          by flying in an upwards direction and also not over reacting.
        - Added code so that the slider works in the camera view from the boid.
        - Fixed the size problem, when new boids are added with the slider.
        - Added a rapid clock timer on a CStatic on the control panel for
          reference.

v0.4941   Start Date: 01/09/1999   Finish Date: 02/09/1999
        - Produced the first version of a working flat shaded landscape made of
          triangles.  Normals are manually calculated when triangles are
          produced.

v0.494    Start Date: 29/08/1999   Finish Date: 01/09/1999
        - Successfully added an isometric landscape to the simulation, but
          I have decided that it is too rigid and unnatural looking.  Also
          the code implementation is quite large.
          Therefore I will save this work, but convert it in the next version
          to a more manipulative landscape with dynamic face normal
          calculations.

v0.493    Start Date: 21/08/1999   Finish Date: 29/08/1999
        - Added code to create a mesh internally by using arrays.
          Unfortunately when tested, acute vertex angles became distorted.
          Also NT4 was jerky when the meshes were dynamically scaled with the
          slider.  Therefore reverting back to v4.92 and keeping to pre created
          meshes.

v0.492    Start Date: 10/08/1999   Finish Date: 21/08/1999
        - Changed the vector representation to the type speed & direction.
        - Tested in Windows NT4, no problems.
        - Added code for the object's required speed & heading.
        - Added code to display the current number of objects above the slider.
        - Added a static control to display the current frames per second.
        - Tested in Windows NT4, found the frame rate to be up to 50% faster.
        - Added flock forming behaviour function called directToBoid( ).
        - Improved the turning of the boids so that they turn to the shortest
          direction.
        - Added collision avoidance behaviour function called
          collisionAvoidance( ).
        - Added constants to limit the min & max boid speeds.
        - Added velocity matching behaviour function called velocityMatching( ).

v0.491    Start Date: 05/08/1999   Finish Date: 10/08/1999
        - Changed the rotation slider to control the number of objects
          dynamically.
        - Tested in Windows NT4, no problems.
        - Added an extra slider to control the sizes of the objects.
        - Tested in Windows NT4 again, no problems.

v0.49     Start Date: 03/08/1999   Finish Date: 05/08/1999
        - Added coded to randomise the initial positions and velocities of the
          objects.
        - Added an STL vector that holds pointers to the objects.
        - Successfully tested the application in Windows NT4.
        - Added a data member to the window class stating the number of objects.
        - Added a constant for the initial number of objects.
        - Changed the timing technique from system time to process time
          ( clock( ); ).
        - Successfully tested the application in Windows NT4 again, very smooth.

v0.483    Start Date: 30/07/1999   Finish Date: 03/08/1999
        - Implemented correct timing of the moving objects by virtue of using
          the system clock.
        - Correctly converted the bird meshes to the DirectX file format.
        - Fixed to orientation of the bird and stealth meshes.
        - Renamed the function names position & velocity to setPosition &
          setVelocity.
        - Added handle to parent window in the object class, to enable message
          boxes.
        - Tested in NT4 and found that it ran very smoothly.

v0.482    Start Date: 30/07/1999   Finish Time: 30/07/1999
        - Tried to smooth the timing by using D3DRM set velocity functions, but
          the rendering speeds are still inconsistent for the simulation.
          Reverting back to v4.7 yet again.

v0.481    Start Date: 30/07/1999   Finish Date: 30/07/1999
        - Tried to smooth the timing by calling the move object function
          from within the applications on idle function, but still have erratic
          speeding up.  Reverting back to v4.7 again.

v0.48     Start Date: 27/07/1999   Finish Date: 30/07/1999
        - Used an MFC timer to stabilize the simulation timing, but the effects
          produced are jerky and undesirable.
          Reverting back to v4.7 for re-development.
