        <P>NOTE: These instructions work in most programs with a "loft" or

        isn't necessarily the best for you, but the basic technique of lofting a 
        surface from radial cross-sections remains valuable for building a 
        variety of organic surfaces, including arms and torsos and other forms.

        <P align=center><B>HOW TO BUILD IT</B></P>
        <P>This tutorial shows how to build a head out of one continuous NURBS 
        component for the whole head, rather than using multiple components 
        blended together.</P>
        <P>1. Start by drawing a single spline curve in the side-view window, to 
        represent for the profile of the the head. (This is the line shown in 
        white and blue below.)</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P><IMG height=424 src="NURBS Head Tutorial_fichiers/skinning.gif" 
            width=352 align=bottom><BR><I>Start simple, and build in more detail 
            after you like the basic shape.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>2. Once the profile has been drawn in and looks good, make copies of 
        that curve, and rotate the copies so that they all come together at the 
        top of the scalp, much like the top of a primitive sphere. These lines 
        should be in the position of the ones shown in black above.</P>
        <P>3. Modify each copy so that they represent the shape at each given 
        angle, such as getting rid of the nose for the splines that are not 
        right in the center. Don't worry about getting it perfect - you can 
        change the positions of some points later on, once you've seen the 
        surface.</P>
        <P>HINT: The fewer curves you use here, the easier it will be complete 
        this tutorial. Start with a simple, basic form, and don't make this too 
        complex on your first try. Note that the figure above uses 9 curves to 
        make half of the head, with 6 in front where more detail is needed, and 
        only 3 to represent the rear of the head.</P>
        <P>4. When you have gone 180-degrees from the front profile, "skin" or 
        "loft" together all of the spline curves, to form half of the head.</P>
        <P>5. Make an instanced copy of the half-head, scaled to -1 in the X 
        axis. This way you can see the whole head, as you tweak half of it.</P>
        <P>6. Move points around, add or subtract rows and columns of points, 
        and tweak the modelling until you are happy. Make sure you have enough 
        edges in the upper eyelids that it will look good in the target shapes 
        that make them close.</P>
        <P align=center><IMG height=425 
        src="NURBS Head Tutorial_fichiers/shaded.jpg" width=338 
        align=bottom><BR><I>This is a "half head" after a few hours of intense 
        tweaking. The immediate result of the loft command had less detail and 
        more glitches.</I></P>
        <P>NOTE: The whole trick here is getting the chords to come together in 
        the places where you need more detail, such as the mouth, nostril area, 
        eyes, and ears. You can see the grid squares mapped onto my rendering 
        becoming thin and merging together as they head into these areas.</P>
        <P>7. Merge the two halves. Being symmetrical at this stage is OK - the 
        target shapes you'll make later can be assymetrical, as with your 
        texture maps, so the final product won't be unrealistically symmetrical 
        because of the symmetrical neutral pose.</P>
        <P>8. Further adjust your model and repeat the skin/loft process if 
        necessary.<BR></P>
        <P><IMG height=613 src="NURBS Head Tutorial_fichiers/HeadWire.gif" 
        width=392></P>
        <P>There's more than one way to skin a head. I made the ears a part of 
        the same surface as the rest of the head. This is tricky to do, since 
        you have to define the edges of the ears going "against the grain" of 
        your parameterization. Just building separate ear objects and sticking 
        them on could be quicker and easier and look almost as good. Instead of 
        single-component heads, a lot of people blend together several different 
        surfaces to make a head.</P>
        <P>Single-component heads update more quickly during animation than 
        blended-together heads, and have a few other advantages that make me 
        choose them. Any area of the face can be addressed to add wrinkles or 
        dimples to a facial expression. A continuous patch surface is guaranteed 
        to look smooth and continuous, with any type of texture mapping, 
        displacement, rendering or animation, while blends aren't always 100% 
        seamless. Continuous heads can easily be moved between application 
        programs as an iges file, whereas the construction histories or 
        relational modeling that make blends possible are more fragile and can't 
        be translated between programs.</P>
        <P>Another issue to think about is the direction of your curves. In this 
        head, they run up and down, becoming opened at the neck (very useful!) 
        but all pinching together at the top of the head. There are other 
        approaches.</P>
        <P>One other way is to make all the curves radiate from the mouth. You 
        can even make curves starting in the mouth twist back around the head to 
        open at the neck, as in the example below:</P>
        <P align=center><A 
        href="http://www.turbosquid.com/HTMLClient/FullPreview/FullPreview.cfm/ID/171082/Action/FullPreview" 
        target=_new><IMG height=250 
        src="NURBS Head Tutorial_fichiers/mouthcenterb.gif" width=400 
        border=2></A><BR>This mouth-centered model, a more professional, 
        animatable approach, is also available from turbosquid if you click the 
        image.</P>
        <P>This character is modelled with curves starting in the mouth, and 
        coming out around the mouth all the way down to the neck. (It is 
        basically a tube, in which one end is the mouth, the other is the neck.) 
        The grid shows where the U and V direction curves move through the 
        surface. Since you don't get quite as much detail in the eye area this 
        way, it might not be the best way to make a highly detailed NURBS human, 
        but I use geometry like this for many character and creature heads. It's 
        much quicker and easier to make the mouth keyposes and animate the head 
        talking with this kind of model.</P>

        expressions, see the <A
