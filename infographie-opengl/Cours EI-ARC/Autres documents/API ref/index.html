<H1> The OpenGL WWW Pages</H1>
**Note** This collection of web pages is a local Tulane copy of materials 
provided by <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.digital.com/pub/doc/opengl/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.digital.com/pub/doc/opengl/'" tppabs="http://www.digital.com/pub/doc/opengl/">Digital Equipment Corporation</A> for public distribution.<P>

The OpenGL man pages have been reformatted into HTML for your
reference. At this time it is not part of our Open3D product, but
merely a convenience for our customers. (And web surfers.)
<P> HTML does not have a good way to write mathematic equations.
I have done my best to represent the various formulas in the man
pages into something readable on character-based readers. I have used 
one ISO Latin-1 one character, the raised dot (·, hex b7), to indicate 
multiplication. If this is a problem for people I can change it to `*'.
Superscripts are placed on the line above and subscripts are placed on 
the line below their referent. Fortunately I didn't run across any
instances of subscripts on one line followed by superscripts on the
line below.
<P> My primary goals are 
<OL> 
<LI> Make the man pages readable and correct.
<LI> Make sure the formulas, equations and tables are readable and correct.
<LI> Keep all information visible for character based readers.
</OL>
Making everything look pretty is not as important.
<P> If you find any errors or if you have any suggestions, please send
mail to <A HREF="mailto:andy.vesper@eng.pko.dec.com">
andy.vesper@eng.pko.dec.com</A> or 
<A HREF="mailto:andy.vesper@pko.mts.dec.com">
andy.vesper@pko.mts.dec.com</A>. I will try to fix them up as I find
time. Unfortunately this is a volunteer effort and I so I cannot spend
much time on it.
<P> To start, choose either the 
<A HREF="opengl_index_alpha.html" tppabs="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/graphics/doc/OpenGL-Man-Pages/opengl_index_alpha.html"><B>alphabetic order</B></A> page or
<A HREF="opengl_index_spec.html" tppabs="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/graphics/doc/OpenGL-Man-Pages/opengl_index_spec.html"><B>specification order</B></A> page.

<P> There is also an introductory page located at 
<A HREF="glXIntro.html" tppabs="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/graphics/doc/OpenGL-Man-Pages/glXIntro.html">glXIntro</A>.

<P> The GLU tesselator has changed in version 1.2; here are some
<A HREF="opengl_new_glu.html" tppabs="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/graphics/doc/OpenGL-Man-Pages/opengl_new_glu.html">notes on the new GLU tesselator</A><BR><BR>

<P> Due to popular demand, I have added a 
<A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/graphics/doc/OpenGL-Man-Pages/opengl.tar  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/graphics/doc/OpenGL-Man-Pages/opengl.tar'" tppabs="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/graphics/doc/OpenGL-Man-Pages/opengl.tar">tar file</A> and a

all the .html sources. Note that the names are long names with the
extension .html, and so are not appropriate to being placed
on a DOS disk.

In this document all formulae are given as images, so they look much
better than my ASCII art.
